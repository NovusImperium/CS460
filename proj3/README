Project 3, Semantic Analyzer and expression Evaluator
Authors: Aman Gill and Lowell Olson

What our program can do.

1) Correctly identify lexical, syntactic and semantic errors for our grammar.
2) Build a symbol table.
3) Correctly evaluate the expressions.
4) Correctly initialize a list of variables
5) Correctly evaluate a ternary conditional (nested conditions have undefined behavior)
6) Write the dbg, lst, and sym files with all dats, with the exception of the operators in the sym file.
