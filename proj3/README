Project 3, Semantic Analyzer and expression Evaluator
Authors: Aman Gill and Lowell Olson

What our program can do.

1) Correctly identify lexical, syntactic and semantic errors for our grammar.
2) Build a symbol table.
3) Incorrectly evaluate the expressions.

We are currently having problems with the evaluation portion of the program.
